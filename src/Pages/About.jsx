<p className="py-2">I'm Ash - a 30-year-old female, blessed in the Inner West of Sydney. I follow a vegan diet, I love animals, I love glitter and tacky shit, I love carbs, I love sunsets/sunrises, I have a strange rescue dog called Bae, I love everything mindset-focused, I love (a few too many) roses, and I love that you’re here, reading this.</p>

<p className="py-2">I was born and raised in the Inner West of Sydney. My upbringing was everything you would expect (and probably more) growing up in social housing with a single mom. I left home at 15 years old due to domestic violence and drug use surrounding me. I began working in retail despite absolutely hating it!</p>

<p className="py-2">I kept working the retail ladder and began working night shifts at a strip club in X-cross. I was about 20 years old then and soon met my (abusive) boyfriend who I would stay with for 5 years. During this time, my mental health was almost as bad as it could be. I think this is where my love for training/the gym began. Between not wanting to be at home with an abusive boyfriend and a debilitating mental illness, the gym was my time that was mine. No one else's; Not his. Not my mental illnesses. No one's time but mine. Yes, I was terrified of the gym. I would go in early mornings when no one was there because I was WAY too self-conscious. But I kept going; I was so determined to feel comfortable there. It was almost like I needed to prove it to myself, that I COULD do it.</p>

<p className="py-2">I put myself through TAFE and completed my certificates in community services. During my placement, I managed to hustle and snag myself a job. I quit retail (I had already been forced to quit adult entertainment by boyfriend) and began a career in social welfare. I went on to do a Bachelor of Social Science. All whilst working full-time AND in an abusive relationship. I can honestly say training/fitness saved me during that relationship. I didn’t realize it until after the fact, of course.</p>

    <p className="py-2">I finally left him. And after a few years and an AVO later, I was free. I began working in adult entertainment again and was still training hard. Along with sex work, training became one of the only consistencies and predictable things in my life. I was still working in community services; in a large charity working with high-risk populations; homelessness, severe mental health, and drug addiction. Continuous trips to hospitals/psych wards/prisons to visit my clients became my everyday life. I'd be lying if I said I didn't love it; I love to help people. I knew this from an early age. It was so clear. I just didn't have the resources to do it sooner. By this time, I had my own online coach who I adored and began REALLY taking my training/health/fitness seriously. I started wearing JUST a crop when training. I began walking into the gym with power, purpose, and passion. I was officially obsessed.</p>

<p className="py-2">The worldly event no little girl/boy in the 90's or early 2000's planned for. As many people (and we LOVE to see it) I had some life epiphanies during lockdown. More than some. Probably too many. But it led me to studying my pt/fitness qualifications. I figured it was the next logical step. I had been supporting women on their fitness journeys under the direction of my coach on his program. And I loved it. At some point between then and now, I was going to compete in bodybuilding comp WBFF. I got 10 weeks into my prep and pulled the pin due to uncontrollable life things. The stage will always be there, and one day I will get there! For now, it's all about YOU - my clients. I'm weird, I'm unhinged, I'm non-conventional but I AM committed to ensuring I can be the best coach I can be for you. I truly feel my strange assortment of experience and knowledge all fits together perfectly to best support YOU.</p>

<p className="py-2">As I said a few pages earlier - Nothing is too much, too weird, too embarrassing for me. I hope you now know why. I hope you feel a little more comfortable now you have gotten to know me more. I'm looking forward to getting to know you!</p>
