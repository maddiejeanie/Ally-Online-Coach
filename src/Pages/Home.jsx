<p><strong>My goal</strong> is to <strong>single-handedly educate you</strong> with the tools and knowledge to be the <strong>strongest and most confident version of yourself; physically and mentally</strong>. This is my <strong>prime focus when coaching you</strong>. From today on, start thinking deeper about your goals. Over the next week or so, we'll get <strong>real specific with your goals</strong>. Together, we will engineer a game plan and work out what we can both do to make your journey to your goal as <strong>fun and achievable as possible</strong>.</p>

<p>My vision is to have a society of women who are set-free of the <strong>misleading, harmful and infuriating misinformation surrounding fitness and nutrition</strong> floating around our <strong>Instagram/social media feeds</strong>.</p>

<p>My vision is to have a society of women who train to feel <strong>strong, empowered, fierce</strong>, and that possess the knowledge of <strong>results-driven training methods</strong>.</p>

<p>My vision is to have more women in the world who <strong>unapologetically do it all</strong>, regardless of a social norm.</p>

<p>My vision is to have more women utilizing training as an enjoyable and <strong>non-negotiable part of their self-care routine</strong>.</p>

<p>My vision is to have more women walking into gyms like they own the place. To have women that genuinely support each other.</p>

<p>I want to see more women who are <strong>unapologetically 'do it all'</strong>; the party girl, the mom, the gym rat, the yogi queen, the nerd, the sport fan, the feminine, soft caring person, the direct, assertive person, the wife, the risk-taker, the quiet one, the wife, the Madonna, the social rights activist, the sex worker, the business owner, the whore, the white-collar professional, the whore, <strong>et al.</strong></p>

<p>That is my goal. That is my vision for the future. That is the reason I do what I do.</p>

<p>Dream big and do bigger.</p>
